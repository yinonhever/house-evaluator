# House Evaluator

## About

**Home Evaluator** is a full-stack application used to save and display information about houses. The front-end is built with React and Next.js, while the back-end is built with Node.js and Express. The entire project is built with TypeScript.

## How to run

To run the full-stack application using NPM, open two different terminals â€“ navigate to the _frontend_ directory in one of them, and to the _backend_ directory in the other. In both directories, run the following two commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The front-end would be available on **_http://localhost:3000_**, while the back-end would be available on **_http://localhost:5000_**.
